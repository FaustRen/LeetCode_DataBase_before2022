#### Problem Statement

Given an array of `n` integers, your task is to count the number of `unique` pairs of integers in the array that have a difference of `k`.

#### Input

The first line of input contains two integers `n` and `k`, the size of the array and the difference between the two integers respectively.

The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `arr[i]` where `0 â‰¤ i < n`.

#### Output

Print the number of unique pairs of integers in the array that have a difference of `k`.

#### Example

##### Example 1

**Input**
