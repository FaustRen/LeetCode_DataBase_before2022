## LeetCode 210. Shortest Distance in a Plane

### Problem

Given a list of points on a 2D plane, find the shortest distance between two points.

### Input

The input is a list of points on a 2D plane, represented as a 2D array of integers.

### Output

The output is an integer representing the shortest distance between two points.

### Example

#### Example 1

Input: `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]`

Output: `2`

Explanation: The shortest distance between two points is the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4), which is 2.

#### Example 2

Input: `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]`

Output: `4`

Explanation: The shortest distance between two points is the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (5,6), which is 4.
