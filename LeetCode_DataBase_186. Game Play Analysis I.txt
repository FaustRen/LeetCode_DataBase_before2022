### Problem Statement

You are given a table `logs` that includes a column `player_id` and `event_name`.

Write a SQL query to find the number of distinct players who started a game but did not complete it.

Table: `logs`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| player_id   | int     |
| event_name  | varchar |

### Example

Input

| player_id | event_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | start      |
| 1         | end        |
| 2         | start      |
| 3         | start      |
| 3         | end        |

Output

| count |
| ----- |
| 1     |

Explanation

Only player 2 started the game but did not complete it.

```mysql
SELECT player_id, event_date, COUNT(DISTINCT event_name) 
FROM Activity 
GROUP BY player_id, event_date 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT event_name) > 1;
```
