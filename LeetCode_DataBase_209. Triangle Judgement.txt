## 209. Triangle Judgement

### Description
Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, determine if they form a valid triangle.

### Example

#### Example 1:

**Input:** a = 2, b = 2, c = 2

**Output:** true

#### Example 2:

**Input:** a = 3, b = 4, c = 5

**Output:** true

#### Example 3:

**Input:** a = 1, b = 1, c = 3

**Output:** false

### Note

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers in the range [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1].
- The triangle can have sides with length 0, in which case it is degenerate and not considered a triangle.

### Solution

```
class Solution {
    public boolean triangleJudgement(int a, int b, int c) {
        if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0) return false;
        return (a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

We can use the triangle inequality theorem to determine if three given sides can form a valid triangle. The theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. Therefore, if the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side, then the three sides cannot form a valid triangle. We can check this condition for all three combinations of sides and return `true` if all three conditions are satisfied.
