## 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

### Problem

Given an array of integers, find the kth largest element in the array.

### Note

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

### Example 1:

Input: `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` and k = 2

Output: `5`

### Example 2:

Input: `[3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6]` and k = 4

Output: `4`

### Explanation

The kth largest element in an array is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

In Example 1, the kth largest element is 5.

In Example 2, the kth largest element is 4.

SELECT MAX(number) AS biggest_single_number
FROM (SELECT number FROM table_name
      GROUP BY number
      HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) AS t;
