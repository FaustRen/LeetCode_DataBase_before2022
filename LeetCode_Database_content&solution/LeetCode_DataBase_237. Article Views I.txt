## LeetCode 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

### Problem

Given a node in a singly-linked list, delete the node. Note that we do not have access to any other nodes of the linked list, like the head or the tail.

### Example

**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

**Output:** [4,1,9]

### Explanation

The linked list given is `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9`. We are given the node `5`, which is the second node in the list. We delete the node `5` and the new linked list becomes `4 -> 1 -> 9`.
