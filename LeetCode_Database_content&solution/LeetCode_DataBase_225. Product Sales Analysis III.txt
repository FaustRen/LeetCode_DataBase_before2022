Table: Sales Analysis

| product_name | total_quantity | total_price |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| A            | 15             | 150         |
| B            | 5              | 100         |
| C            | 0              | 0           |

Explanation:

Product A has a total quantity of 10 from order 1 and 5 from order 3, and a unit price of 10, so the total price is 10 * 10 + 10 * 5 = 150.

Product B has a total quantity of 5 from order 2 and a unit price of 20, so the total price is 20 * 5 = 100.

Product C has no orders, so the total quantity and total price are both 0.ã€‚

SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(s.price) AS total_sales
FROM Sales s
LEFT JOIN Product p
    ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
