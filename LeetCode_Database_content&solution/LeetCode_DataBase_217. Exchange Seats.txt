## 217. Exchange Seats

### Description

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column `id` is continuous increment.

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

### Table: `seat`

| id  | student |
|-----|---------|
| 1   | Abbot   |
| 2   | Doris   |
| 3   | Emerson |
| 4   | Green   |
| 5   | Jeames  |

### Example

Input:

| id  | student |
|-----|---------|
| 1   | Abbot   |
| 2   | Doris   |
| 3   | Emerson |
| 4   | Green   |
| 5   | Jeames  |

Output:

| id  | student |
|-----|---------|
| 1   | Doris   |
| 2   | Abbot   |
| 3   | Green   |
| 4   | Emerson |
| 5   | Jeames  |

### Explanation

The adjacent students in the table are `Abbot` and `Doris`, `Emerson` and `Green`, `Green` and `Jeames`.

So we need to change their seats.

### Solution

```
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id + 1
    END AS id,
    CASE 
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN (SELECT student FROM seat WHERE id = seat.id - 1)
        ELSE (SELECT student FROM seat WHERE id = seat.id + 1)
    END AS student
FROM seat
ORDER BY id
```

UPDATE seat
SET student = CASE
    WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN student + 2
    ELSE student - 2
END
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1;
