## 175. Combine Two Tables

### Problem
Table: `Person`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |

Table: `Address`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

- FirstName
- LastName
- City
- State

### Example

**Input**

Person table:

| PersonId | FirstName | LastName |
| -------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1        | John      | Doe      |
| 2        | Bob       | Smith    |

Address table:

| AddressId | PersonId | City    | State |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| 1         | 1        | New York| NY    |
| 2         | 2        | Boston  | MA    |

**Output**

| FirstName | LastName | City    | State |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| John      | Doe      | New York| NY    |
| Bob       | Smith    | Boston  | MA    |

### Explanation

We can use an `INNER JOIN` to join the `Person` and `Address` tables on the `PersonId` column. This will give us all the people who have an address. We can then use a `LEFT JOIN` to join the `Person` and `Address` tables on the `PersonId` column. This will give us all the people, regardless if they have an address or not.

SELECT 
    Person.FirstName, 
    Person.LastName, 
    Address.City, 
    Address.State
FROM Person 
LEFT JOIN Address 
    ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
