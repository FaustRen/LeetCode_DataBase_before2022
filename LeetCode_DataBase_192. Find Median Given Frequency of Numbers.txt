## 192. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

### Description
Given an array of integers nums and an array of numbers frequencies, return the median of the given array of numbers after applying the given frequencies.

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], frequencies = [2,3,2,3,3]

**Output:** 3.0

**Explanation:**

The input array of numbers is [1,2,3,4,5], and the corresponding frequencies are [2,3,2,3,3].

The median is calculated by first sorting the numbers according to their frequencies:

- Sorted numbers: [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5]

- The median is the middle element, which is 3.

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], frequencies = [2,3,1]

**Output:** 2.0

**Explanation:**

The input array of numbers is [1,2,3], and the corresponding frequencies are [2,3,1].

The median is calculated by first sorting the numbers according to their frequencies:

- Sorted numbers: [1,1,2,2,2,3]

- The median is the middle element, which is 2.
