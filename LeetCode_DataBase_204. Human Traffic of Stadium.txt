## LeetCode 204. Human Traffic of Stadium

### Problem

You are given a table `visits` recording visitor traffic of a stadium, each row consists of a visitor's name and the time of his/her arrival and leaving.

Write a SQL query to find the visitors who stayed for at least 10 minutes.

| name   | arrival_time | leave_time |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| John   | 08:00        | 08:30      |
| Daniel | 08:15        | 08:45      |
| Mark   | 09:00        | 09:15      |

### Output

| name   |
| ------ |
| John   |
| Daniel |

### Explanation

John and Daniel stayed for 30 and 30 minutes respectively, which is longer than 10 minutes. Mark only stayed for 15 minutes, which is less than 10 minutes.

Therefore, the only visitor in the result table is John and Daniel.
